## Summary:

This was a 3 week long project built during my learning data sets and algorithms. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

I wanted to build an application that allowed users to pull data from the CoinGecho API based on what they were interested in, such as 'most tagged coins'. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `@reach/router` and `redux`.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React,@reach/router, Redux, Victory, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes. In the next iteration I plan on handrolling a `webpack.config.js` file to more fully understand the build process.
